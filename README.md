# React Weather App
**Steps for how I am building my weather app, based on [ReactJS Fundamentals Curriculum](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/react-fundamentals-curriculum)**
##Part 1: Hello World Starter App
First install npm in your project directory

```
npm init
```
The above command will create a **package.json** file in your project directory.

Next, install the npm dependencies you will need:

```
npm install --save axios react react-dom react-router
```

And dev dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-dev-server
```
Create **.babelrc** file in project directory:

```
touch .babelrc
```

Configure the **.babelrc** file:

```
config here
```

Create **webpack.config.js** file in project directory:

```
touch webpack.config.js
```

Configure the **webpack.config.js** file:

```
config here
```

Create and change to the app directory:

```
mkdir app
cd app
```

In the app directory, create **index.html**

```
touch index.html
```

Configure **index.html**:

```
config here
```

Still in the app directory, create **index.js** to render a HelloWorld component:

```
touch index.js
```

Configure index.js
```
config here
```
Start webpack:

```
npm start
```

Test to see that everything is working.
